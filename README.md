# fuzzy-waddle
Part of daily homework I've done during the Data Structure &amp; Algorithm (for non-professional).
## Background
&ensp;&ensp;In the term 2018-2019-2, I choose the general education course *`Computer Algorithm and Program`*, which is lectured by Professor Dai Bo.
Mrs. Dai has given us dozens of problems to practise, and I've done part of them.  
&ensp;&ensp;Suggested by Mrs. Dai and considering my interest, I choose `Python` as coding language instead of `C`.
## Module
Examples include following modules:
* Programming Basic
* Bubble Sort
* Binary Search
* Recursion
* Queue & Stack
* Breadth-first search (BFS)
